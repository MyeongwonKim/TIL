### Supervised learning
- Supervised learning is where you have input variables (x) and an output variable (Y) and you use an algorithm to learn the mapping function from the input to the output Y = f(X).
- The goal is to approximate the mapping function so well that when you have new input data (x) that you can predict the output variables (Y) for that data.
- Supervised learning requires that the data used to train the algorithm is **already labeled with correct answers**. 
- Supervised learning problems can be further grouped into Regression and Classification problems. The difference between the two tasks is the fact that the dependent attribute is **numerical for regression** and **categorical for classification**.

### Regression and Classification
- A regression problem is when the output variable is a **real or continuous value**, such as “salary” or “weight”.
- A classification problem is when the output variable is **a category**, such as “red” or “blue” or “disease” and “no disease”.
- Classification models include logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, gradient-boosted tree, multilayer perceptron, one-vs-rest, and Naive Bayes.
