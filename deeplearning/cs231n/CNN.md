## CNN
- convolution: taking a filter, sliding it spatially over the image, and computiong the dot product at every location
- keeping the image structure
- one filter results in one activation map and represents one pattern in the input.
- Stacked convolutional layers gradully represent more complex features in the input.
- Output size: (N - F) / stride + 1
- CNN layer: Each neuron looks at the local spatial region. Activation value means "how much a neuron fired in this position".
- cf) Fully-Connected Layer: Each neuron looks at the full input volume
-  Pooling layer
  - down sampling
  - Output size: (N - F) / stride + 1
