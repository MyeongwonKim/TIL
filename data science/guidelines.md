## Crucial Skills for Full Stack Data Science (not just ML)

- Most people pursuing education/online training have a misconception that all data scientists build fancy machine learning models, but thatâ€™s not always true.
- The force driving people towards pursuing data science is due to the hype around artificial intelligence and its business impact.
- Other crucial skills are needed for data scientist role hunting.

1. **Distributed Data Processing**: Hands-on experience with technologies such as Apache Spark, Apache Hadoop, Dask, etc. can help you prove that you can create Data/ML pipelines at scale.

2. **Production ML/Data Pipelines**: Apache Airflow, a standard open-source job orchestration tool for creating data and machine learning pipelines.

3. **DevOps/Cloud**: Getting familiar with Docker, Kubernetes, and building ML applications with frameworks like Flask

4. **Databases**: Most of the feature engineering can be done on-the-go while getting the data to your models with SQL.

5. **Programming Languages**: Python, R, Scala, and Java.
