## Chapter 1 Introduction

- An operating system is a program that manages the computer hardware. It also provides a basis for application programs and acts as an **intermediary** between the computer user and the computer hardware.

- In user's view, the operating system is designed mostly for ease of use, with some attention paid to performance.

- In system's view,  we can view an operating system as a **resource allocator**.

- For a computer to start running, it needs to have an initial program to run. This initial program, or **bootstrap program**, tends to be simple. Typically, it is stored in read-only memory (ROM)

- General-purpose computers run most of their programs from rewriteable memory,called main memory(also called **random-access memory or RAM**). 

- Most programs (system and application) are stored on a **disk** until they are loaded into memory. Many programs then use the disk as both the source and the destination of their processing.
